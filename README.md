3.  **API Key Setup (Crucial Step):**
    * Create a file named **`.env`** in the project root.
    * Add your API key (if required by the video/project setup) inside this file (e.g., `VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`). *Note: Do not commit the actual API key to GitHub.*
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
